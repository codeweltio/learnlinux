CHAPTER 10. ANALYZING AND STORING LOGS

1. System log Architecture
	a. Logs stored in /var/log
	b. syslog messages handled by two services
		i.  system-journald
		ii. rsyslog
	c. System log files
		i. /var/log/messages: most syslog messages logged here, exceptions: authentication, email processing, purely debugging related
		ii. /var/log/secure: security, authentication and others
		iii.  /var/log/mail log: mail server related
		iv. /var/log/cron: periodically executed tasks
		v. /var/log/boot.log: system startup

2. Reviewing syslog files
	a. man rsyslog.conf
	b. syslog priorities
	Code		Priority			Severity
	0		emerg			system is unusable
	1		alert			action must be taken immediately
	2		crit			critical condition	
	3		err			non critical error condition
	4		warning		warning condition
	5		notice		normal but significant event
	6		info			informational event
	7 		debug			debugging-level message

3. Log file rotation
	a. logrotate, keep them from filling up the file system containing /var/log
	b. when log is rotated, renamed with extension indicating date of rotation
		old: /var/log/messages
		new: /var/log/messages-20141030, rotated on 30 October 2014
	c. After 4 weeks, old log file is discarded to free space

4. Analyze a syslog entry
	a. Log entries in log files are recorder in a standard format
		i. Time stamp when the log entry was recorded ii. Host from which log message was sent iii. Program or process that sent the log message iv. Actual message sent
	b. Monitor a log file with tail
		tail -f /var/log/secure
	c. Send a syslog message with logger
		logger -p user.notice “message”

5. Maintaining accurate time
	a. timedatectl: overview of current time related system
	b. timedatectl list-timezones
	c. timedatectl set-ntp true (NTP sychronise for time adjustment)

6. Configuring and monitoring chronyd
	a. systemctl restart chronyd
	b. chronyc sources -v
