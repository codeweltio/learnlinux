			S-task imterruptible : the process is waiting for some condition
			D-task uninterruptible : this process is also sleeping but will not respond to delivered signal
			K-task killable : identical to D state but modified to allow the waiting task to respond to a signal to be killed.
			T-task stopped : the process has been suspended by any uiser or another process.
			Z-exit zombie : a child process signals its parent as it exists.
			X-exit dead : wehn a parent cleans up the remaining child process structure ,the process is now released completely.
