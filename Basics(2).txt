        Linux File System Hierarchy
       ----------------------------

Note
 ----
 * The directory / is the root directory. The / character is also used as a directory separator in file names.
 
 * The following terms are encountered in describing file system directory contents:
  - "static" is content that remains unchanged until explicitly edited or reconfigured.
  - "dynamic" or "variable" is content typically modified or appended by active processes.
  - "persistent" is content, particularly configuration settings, that remain after a reboot.
  - "runtime" is process or system-specific content or attributes cleared during reboot. 

 -Important Linux Directories-

 /usr  -: Installed software, shared libraries, include files, and static read-only program data.
            Important subdirectories include:
            - /usr /bin: User commands & utilities are located here.
            - /usr/sbin: System administration commands , for root use, are here
            - /usr /local: Locally customized software.

 /etc   -: Configuration files specific to this system. 

 /var   -: Variable data specific to this system that should persist between boots.
           Files that dynamically change may be found under /var. 
           eg.: cache directories, log files,  websites

 /run   -: Runtime data for processes sta rted since the last boot. This includes process 
           ID files and lock files, among ot her thi ngs. The contents of this directory are
           recreated on reboot.

 /home  -: Home directories where regular users store their personal data and
           configuration files.

 /root  -: Home directory for the administrative superuser, root.

 /tmp   -: Space for temporary files. Files are deleted from this directory automatically after a specific duration.
           Another temporary directory exists, /var/tmp .

 /boot  -: Files needed in order to start the boot process.  

 /dev   -: Contains special device files which are used by the system to access hardware.
