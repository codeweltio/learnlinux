    ANALYZING AND STORING LOGS 
    --------------------------
    
    System logging
    --------------
     • /var/log directory is where these logs are persistently stored.
     • syslog messages are handled by two services
         - systemd-journald :- system service that collects and stores logging data
         -  rsyslog :- sorts the syslog messages by type and priority, and writes them to persistent files in the /var/log 
              ( /var/log directory holds various system-specific and service-specific log files maintained by rsyslog)

     system log files
     ----------------
     - /var/log/messages :- Most syslog messages are logged here  (except messages related to authentication and email processing ,debugging related.)    
     - /var/log/secure :- The log file for security and authentication-related messages and errors   
     - /var/log/maillog :- The log file with mail server-related messages. 
     - /var/log/cron :- The log file related to periodically executed tasks. 
     - /var/log/boot :- log Messages related to system startup . 

    Reviewing Syslog Files 
    ----------------------

    syslog prioritie
    ----------------
    - emerg(0)  :- System is unusable
    - alert(1)  :- Action must be taken immediately
    - crit(2)   :- Critical condition
    - err (3)   :- Non-critical error condition
    - warning(4) :- Warning condition
    - notice(5) :- Normal but significant event
    - info (6)  :- Informational event.
    - debug (7) :- Debugging-level message. 

    Log file rotation
    -----------------
    • logrotate utility to keep them from filling up the file system containing /var/log/

    Analyze a syslog entry
    ----------------------
     log entries format
     eg. Feb 11 20:11:48 localhost sshd[1433] : Failed password for student from 0.0.0.0 port 1 ssh2 

    1. The time stamp when the log entry was recorded.
    2. The host from which the log message was sent.
    3. The program or process that sent the log message.
    4. The actual message sent. 

    Monitor a log file with tail
    ----------------------------
     - tail -f /path/to/file  :- outputs the last 10 lines of the file specified and continues to output new lines as 
                                 they get written to the monitored file. 

    Send a syslog message with logger 
     ------------------------------
     - logger  :- to make entries into the system log

    Finding events with journalctl
    ------------------------------
     - journalctl :- shows the full system journal, starting with the oldest log entry
           - -n  :- shows the last 10 log entries
           - -p  :- takes either the name or the number of the known priority levels and shows the given levels and all higher-level entries
           - -f  :- outputs the last 10 lines of the journal and continues to output new journal entries
           - --since and --until :- To limit the output to a specific time range ( format YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss OR yesterday,today and tomorrow)
                                      Eg.  journalctl --since today
           - -b :- To limit the output to a specific system boot                           
                To search for lines relevant to a particular process or event                      
                 • _COMM :- The name of the command
                 • _EXE  :- The path to the executable for the process 
                 • _PIO  :- The PIO of the process
                 • _UIO  :- The UIO of the user running the process
                 • _SYSTEMO_UNIT :- The systemd unit that started the process  

                   Eg.  journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT=sshd.service _PID=1182                    

     Store The System Journal Permanently
     ----------------------------------- 
     Note 
     ----
     • By default, the system journals are kept in the /run/log/journal directory, which means the journals are cleared when the system reboots.
      You can change the configuration settings of the systemd-journald service in the /etc/systemd/journald.conf file to make the journals persist across reboot.
        • persistent :- stores journals in the /var/log/journal directory which persists across reboots.
        • volatile :- stores journals in the volatile /run/log/journal directory.
        • auto :- rsyslog determines whether to use persistent or volatile storage.

    Set local clocks and time zone
    ------------------------------
     - timedatectl :- shows an overview of the current time-related system settings, including current time, time zone, and NTP synchronization settings    
          - set-time HH:MM:SS  :- To change the current time
                     YYYY-MM-DD  :- To change the current date
          - list-timezones :- To list all available time zones
          - set-timezone (time_zone) :- To change the currently used time zone
          - set-ntp {yes(true) or no(false)} :- NTP service can be enabled and disabled

    Configuring and Monitoring chronyd 
    ---------------------------------- 
     - To reconfigure the chronyd server to synchronize with new server instead of the default servers configured in the /etc/chrony.conf ,
        remove the other server entries and replace them with new. Then restart the service using systemctl 
        - iburst :- for clock synchronization
        eg. :- server classroom.example.com iburst 
     - chronyc sources :-  to verify the NTP server was used to synchronize the system clock
                  - -v  :- for more verbose output with additional explanations about the output
