    ACCESSING LINUX FILE SYSTEMS

   Identifying File Systems and Devices 
   ------------------------------------



     Examining file systems 
     ----------------------
     - df :- To get an overview about the file system mount points and the amount of free space available
       - -h or -H :- To improve readability of the output sizes ,there are two different human-readable options (KiB or KB)
     - du :- For more detailed information about the space used by a certain directory tree

     Mounting and Unmounting File Systems
     ------------------------------------
     - mount :- allows the root user to manually mount a file system.
     - blkid :- gives an overview of existing partitions with a file system on them and the UUID of the file system, as well
                 as the file system used to format the partition
     - umount :- To unmount a file system
     - lsof :- lists all open files and the process accessing them in the provided directory

    Managing links between files 
    ----------------------------
     - ls -l :- to shows the hard link count after the permissions and before the owner of a file  
     - ln  :- to creates new hard links to existing files
       - -s :- to creates a soft link

    Locating files by name with locate

     - locate :- used to find the files by name
        - -i :- to performs a case-insensitive search
        - -n :- limits the number of returned search results 

    Searching for files with find 
    -----------------------------
     - find :- performs a real-time search in the local file systems to find files that match the criteria of the command-line arguments 
                                          ( To search the entire system, provide a starting directory of / )
        - -name :- to looks up files matching the given file name and returns all exact matches     
        - -user :- searching by owner name
        - -group :- search by group name 
        - -uid and -gid :- search by ID 
        - -perm :- used to look for files with a particular set of permissions
        - -size :- to look up files that match a size specified 
        - -mmin <time> :- searches for all files that had their content changed at exactly the given time in the past
        - -type :- limits the search scope to a given file type ,
                    • f :- for regular file
                    • d :- for directory
                    • 1 :- for soft link
                    • b :- for block device
        - -links :- followed by a number looks for all files that have a certain hard link count. 
                        (The number can be preceded by "+" modifier to look for files with a count higher than the given hard link count.
                        If the number is preceded with "-", the search is limited to all files with a hard link count that is less than the given number)
