   Managing Local Group Accounts
   ----------------------------

           -  -g :- used to specify a specific GID.
           -  -r :- will create a system group using a GID from the range of valid system GID numbers listed in the /etc/login.defs file.

   Managing User Passwords 
   ----------------------
   There are three pieces of information stored in a modern password hash+
     1. The hashing algorithm. The number 1 indicates an MD5 hash. The number 6 appears when a SHA-512 hash is used.  
     2. The salt used to encrypt the hash. (use of a salt prevents two users with the same password from having identical entries) 
     3. The encrypted hash

   /etc/shadow format  :- name:password:lastchange:minage:maxage:warning:inactive:expire:blank

   Password Aging
     ---------
    - chage :- change user password expiry information
       -  -d  :- will force a password update on next login.
       -  -1  :- will list a username's current settings.
       -  -E  :- will expire an account on a specific day. 
       -  -l  :- Show account aging information.
       -  -W  :- Set the number of days of warning before a password change is required.
       -  -M  :- Set the maximum number of days during which a password is valid.

   Restricting Access
    ---------------
    - The usermod command can lock & unlock an account
    - Use of the nologin shell prevents interactive use of the system
