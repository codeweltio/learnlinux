   MANAGING LOCAL LINUX USERS AND GROUPS 
      ****************************
   USER
   ----
   Accounts that can be used to login into a system. Each user is identified by a unique identification number or UID by the system.

   - id :- command is used to show information about the current logged-in user.
         - id username :- To view information about another user

   - ps :- To view process information    
         - ps a :- To view all processes  
         - ps au :- To view the user associated with a process

   -  /etc/passwd :- file, to store information about local users.

         eg:- ares:x:1000:1000:Ares,,,:/home/ares:/bin/bash
             (1)username:(2)password:(3)UID:(4)GID:(5)GECOS:(6)/home/dir:(7)shell

         (1)username is a mapping of a UID to a name for the benefit of human users. 
         (2)password is where, passwords were kept in an encrypted format. They are stored in a separate file called /etc/shadow. 
         (3)UID is a user ID, a number that identifies the user at the most fundamental level
         (4)GID is the user's primary group ID number.
         (5)GECOS field is arbitrary text, which usually includes the user's real name.
         (6)/home/dir is the location of the user's personal data and configuration files
         (7)shell is a program that runs as the user logs in

   Group  
   -----
   Groups have a name and a number (GID). Local groups are defined in /etc/group

     1.Primary Groups :- • Every user has exactly one primary group.

     2.Supplementary Groups  :- • Users may be a member of 0 or more supplementary groups. 
                                • Used to help users have access permissions to files and other resources on the system.

    Gaining Superuser Access 
    -----------------------
     root user  :- also called superuser, a user that has all power over the system 

    - su :- command allows a user to switch to a different user account.                  
          ( su username :-starts a non-login shell)
          ( su - username :-starts a login shell)

    - sudo :- command allows a user to be permitted to run a command as root, or as another user  

    - exit  :- Exit the root to return to the user.
