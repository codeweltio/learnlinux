Basics 
------
   
    CONFIGURING AND SECURING OPENSSH SERVICE 
    ----------------------------------------
    
    Secure Shell
    ------------
     - ssh :- for logging into remote machine and remote execution
       - ssh remoteuser@remotehost :- Connect to a remote shell as a different user on a selected host 
       - ssh remoteuser@remotehost hostname :- Execute a single command (hostname) on a remote host and as a remote user

    SSH Host Keys
    -------------   
     • Host ID's are stored in ~/.ssh/known_hosts on local system
     • Host keys are stored in /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key* on the SSH server

    SSH key-based authentication 
    ---------------------------
     - ssh-keygen :- for key generation
     • the private key ~/.ssh/id_rsa and the public key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. are stored here
     - ssh-add :- add private key identities to the authentication agent
     - ssh-agent :- holds private keys used for public key authentication
     - ssh-copy-id :- copy the key is to another system 

    Customizing SSH Service Configuration 
    -------------------------------------
     • SSH server can be modified in the configuration file /etc/ssh/sshd_config
