UNDERSTANDING TCP/IP ADDRESSING AND SUBNETTING BASICS

• To configure TCP/IP Protocol on windows, it requires 
	o An IP address
	o A subnet mask
	o A default gateway

• IP Address: Ability to connect together networks of different size and systems of different types

• Subnet mask: used to divide an IP address into two parts
	o One part: identifies host (computer)
	o Other part: network to which it belongs

• IP Address: Networks and Hosts
	o IP Address: 32-bit number, uniquely identifies host, expressed in dotted decimal format (192.168.123.132) and its binary notation (110000000101000111101110000100)
	o For IP Address 192.168.123.132
• Network address: 192.168.123 or 192.168.123.0
• Host address: 132 or 0.0.0.132

	o Subnet mask: to determine whether the host is on local subnet or on a remote network
		• It is 32-bit number
		• Default subnet 255.255.255.0
	o IP Address (192.168.123.0): 11000000.10101000.01111011.10001100
	o Subnet mask (255.255.255.0): 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 
	First three set is network address and last set is host address

	o Network class
	IP addresses are divided into classes (A, B & C)
	D & E exists but are not used by end users
		• Class A: 
			• Default subnet mask of 255.0.0.0
			• 0-127, first octet
			• 10.52.36.11: class A address, 1<10<126
		• Class B
			• Default subnet mask of 255.255.0.0
			• 128-191, first octet
			• 172.16.52.63: class B address, 128<172<191
		• Class C
			• Default subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
			• 192-223, first octet
			• 192.168.123.132: class C address, 192=192<223

	o Subnetting
	Binary address with host portion of all ones and all zeros are invalid

	o Default gateways
		• TCP/IP computer communicate with host through a device called router
		• When host attempt to communicate with another device using TCP/IP, performs comparison process
		• Define subnet mask and destination IP address v/s subnet mask and its own IP address
		• Result: Check if it is a local host or a remote host
		• If local host, send packet on the local subnet
		• If remote host, default gateway defined in TCP/IP properties
		Responsibility of router to forward the packet to the correct subnet


ADDRESS RESOLUTION PROTOCOL
	• ARP is a procedure for tracking an IP address back to a physical machine in a LAN
	• This physical machine also has a unique address known as MAC address (Media Access Control)
	• ARP works between layers 2 and 3 of OSI model 
		o Network layer with IP address 
		o Data link layer with MAC address
	• ARP’s job is to translate 32-bit address into 48-bit address and vice versa
	• Transition necessary as IP address are 32-bit and MAC address are 48-bit in IPv4
	• Mapping: packet or unit of data arrives at a gateway to a host machine, packet prompts ARP program to match IP with MAC address
	• Host searches its ARP cache for pre existing translation for that pocket, if doesn’t exists, performs ARP process
