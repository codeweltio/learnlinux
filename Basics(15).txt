Basics 
------
   
    ARCHIVING AND COPYING FILES BETWEEN SYSTEMS  
    -------------------------------------------

     Operate the tar command
     -----------------------
     - tar :- for creating and working with backup archives
        - -c :- create an archive
        - -t :- list the contents of an archive
        - -x :- extract an archive
        - -f file name :- this option needs to be followed by the file name of the archive to use/create
        - -p Preserve the permissions of files and directories when extracting an archive, without subtracting the umask. 
        - -v :- to see which files get added to or extracted from the archive
        - -tf :- To list the content of an archive
        - -xf :- To extract a tar.gz file 
                                        (-v :- print the names of the files being extracted on the terminal)
        - z :- To create gzip compression (filename.tar.gz or filename.tgz)
        - j :-  bzip2 compression (filename.tar.bz2)
        - J :-  xz compression (filename.tar.xz)    
        - xz :- To extract gzip compression
        - xj :- To extract bzip2 compression
        - xJ :- To extract xz compression

    Copy files to or from a remote location with scp
    ------------------------------------------------
     - scp :- transfers files from a remote host to the local system or from the local system to a remote host
              (Remote file system locations are always specified in the format [user@]host(ip):/path for either
                the source or target location of the files to be transferred)
        - -r :- To copy a whole directory tree recursively     

    Transfer files remotely with sftp 
    ---------------------------------
    - sftp :- interactive tool is preferred when uploading or downloading files to a SSH server  
     under sftp session                           (sftp session accepts various commands that work the same way on the remote file system
                                                   as they do in the local file system, such as ls, cd, mkdir, rmdir, and pwd)
      - put :- for uploading files                   
      - get :- for downloading files
        - mget :- to download multiple files 
        (exit command exits the sftp session)

    Synchronize files and folders with rsync
    ----------------------------------------
     - rsync :- to securely copy files from one system to another
        - -n :- to perform a dry run         ( It is recommended to perform a dry run of any rsync operation to ensure no important files 
                                                 get overwritten or deleted)
        - -v :- adds verbos ity to the output as the synchronization proceeds   
        - -a :- stands for "archive mode"
                    Enables the following options all in one 
                        ----------------------------
                 -r :- synchronize recursively the whole directory tree
                 -1 :- synchronize symbolic links
                 -p :- preserve permissions
                 -t :- preserve time stamps
                 -g :- preserve group ownership
                 -o :- preserve the owner of the files
                 -D :- synchronize device files                                           
        - -H :- enables the handling of hardlinks    

          (To enable the synchronization of ACLs{Access control list}, the -A option is required in addition to the -a option, while to synchronize 
           the SELinux{Security-Enhanced Linux} contexts from the source files to the target files, the -X option is to be added)
