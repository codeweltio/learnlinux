    -----------------------------------------

     Red Hat Subscription Management
     -------------------------------
     There are four basic tasks performed with Red Hat Subscription Management tools:
      1. Register a system to a ssociate that system to a Red Hat account.
      2. Subscribe a system to entitle it to updates for selected Red Hat products
      3. Enable repositories to provide software packages
      4. Review and track entitlements which are available or consumed

    Automating registrations and subscriptions 
    ------------------------------------------
    - subscription-manager register --username=yourusername --password=yourpassword :- to register a system to Red Hat account

        - list --consumed :- View consumed subscriptions
        - unregister :- to unregister a system

    Entitlement certificates
    ------------------------
     · Once registered, the entitlement certificates are stored in /etc/pki and its subdirectories
     · /etc/pki/product :- contains certificates which indicate Red Hat products installed on the system.
     · /etc/pki/consumer :- contains certificates which indicate the Red Hat account to which the system is registered.
     · /etc/pki/entitlement :- contains certificates which indicate which subscriptions are attached to the system.

    Software packages and RPM 
    -------------------------
     · RPM package files are named using a combination of the package name-version-release.architecture

       - info <PACKAGENAME> :- gives detailed information about a package, including the disk space needed for installation.  
       - provides <PATHNAME> displays packages that match the pathname specified
