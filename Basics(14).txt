    MANAGING LINUX NETWORKING  
    -------------------------
    
     IPv4 networking
     ---------------
      • TCP/IP standards follow a four-layer network model
       1. Application
       2. Transport
       3. Internet
       4. Link

     IPv4 addresses 
     --------------
     An IPv4 address is a 32-bit number, normally expressed in decimal as four octets ranging in value
     from 0 to 255, separated by dots. The address is divided into two parts: the network part and the host part.

     Network masks are expressed in two forms. The older syntax for a netmask which uses 24 bits for the network part would
     read 255.255.255.0 . A newer syntax, called CIDR notation, would specify a network prefix of /24 .

     IPv4 routing
     ------------
     The routing table entries will list a destination network, which interface to send the t raffic out,
     and the IP address of a ny intermediate router that is required to relay the message to its final
     destination. The routing table entry which matches the destination of the network t raffic is used
     to route it.

     Network interface names
     ----------------------
     • Network interfaces in Linux are shown as eth0, eth1,...
     • Ethernet interfaces - en, WLAN - wl, and WWAN - ww 
     • o for on-board, s for hotplug slot, and p for PCI geographic location represents the type of adapter 

    Displaying IP addresses 
    -----------------------
     - ip :- used to show statistics a bout network performance 

    Troubleshooting routing
    -----------------------
     - ping :- used to test connectivity
     - traceroute or tracepath :- To trace the path to a remote host

     Troubleshooting ports and services
     ----------------------------------
     - ss or netstat :- used to display socket statistics 
        - -n :- Shows numbers instead of names for interfaces and ports.
        - -t :- Show TCP sockets.
        - -u :- Show UDP sockets.
        - -I :- only listening sockets.
        - -a :- all (listening and established) sockets.
        - -p :- Show the process using the sockets.

    Configuring Networking
    ----------------------
    - nmcli :- used for controlling NetworkManager and reporting network status
       - con show :- To display a list of all connections
           - --active :- To list only the active connections 
                                                                    ( Setting and property names are defined in the nm-settings man page)
       - dev status :- to show device status and details 
       - con add .. :- Add a new connection
       - con mod "<ID>" .. :- Modify a connection   
       - con del "<ID>" :- Delete a connection    
       - con up "<ID>"  :- Activate a connection
       - con down "<ID>" :- Deactivate a connection. (The connection will restart if autoconnect is yes)
       - dev dis <DEV>  :- Bring down an interface and temporarily disable autoconnect   
       - net off  :- Disable all managed interfaces  
                                                                     (nm-connection-editor :- to use graphical interface)       

    Modifying network configuration 
    -------------------------------
     • ifcfg File location  /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg - <name> (<name> refers to the name of the device or connection that the configuration file controls)

      Configuration Options for ifcfg File   
         ---------------------------
       Static :-
                - BOOTPROTO=none
                - IPADDR0=172.25.X.10
                - PREFIX0=24
                - GATEWAY0=172.25.X.254
                - DEFROUTE=yes
                - DNS1=172.25.254.254
       Dynamic :-
                 - BOOTPROTO=dhcp
       Either :-
                - DEVICE=eth0
                - NAME= " System eth0 "
                - ONBOOT=yes 
                - UUID=f3e8dd32-3 ...  
                - USERCTL=yes
        - run "nmcli con reload" to make networkManager read the configuration changes   

    Configuring Host Names and Name Resolution
    ------------------------------------------
     -  hostname :- displays host name 
     -  hostnamectl :- used to modify this file 
             - status :- used to view the status of host name
     - getent hosts hostname :-  used to test host name resolution with the /etc/hosts file
     - host HOSTNAME :- used to test DNS server connectivity
