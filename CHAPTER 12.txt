CHAPTER 12. ARCHIVING AND COPYING FILES BETWEEN SYSTEMS

1. Managing compressed tar Archives
	a. tar: gather large sets of files into a single file (archive)
	b. compressed using: gzip, bzip 2, xz

2. Operate the tar command
	a. c: create an archive
	b. t: list the contents of archive
	c. x: extract an archive
	Commonly used options
	d. f filename: file name of the archive to operate on
	e. v: verbosity: to see which files get added to or extracted from the archive

3. Archive files and directories with tar
	a. tar cf “filename of archive to be created” “list of files and directories that should get added to the archive”

4. List contents of a tar archive
	a. tar tf “file name”

5. Extract an archive created with tar
	a. Extracted in an empty directory to ensure it does not overwrite existing file
	b. First make new directory: mkdir /root/etcbackup
	c. Change directory to that directory: cd /root/etcbackup
	d. Extract: tar xf /root/etc.tar
	e. To preserve the permission of an archived file: tar xpf /root/etc.tar

6. Create a compressed tar archive
	a. z: gzip compression (filename.tar.gz/filename.tgz)
	b. j: bzip2 compression (filename.tar.bz2)
	c. J: xz compression (filename.tar.xz)
	d. tar czf /root/etcbackup.tar.gz /etc: create a gzip compressed tar archive /root/etcbackup.tar.gz of the /etc directory
	e. tar cjf /root/logbackup.tar.bz2/var/log: create a bzip2 compressed tar archive /root/logbackup.tar.bz2 of /var/logdirectory

7. Extract a compressed tar archive
	a. mkdir /tmp/etcbackup
	b. cd/tmp/etcbackup
	c. tar xzf /root/etcbackup.tar.gz

8. Copying files between systems securely
Copy files to or from a remote location with scp
	a. scp /etc/yum.conf /etc/hosts server:/home/student: copy local files on desktop /etc/yum.conf and /etc/hosts to account student on remote system server into the directory /home/student/
	b. scp serverX: /etc/hostname /home/student/: copy file /etc/hostname from account student on the serverX machine to local directory /home/student
	c. scp -r root@serverX: /var/log/tmp: To copy whole directory tree recursively /var/lg on serverX to /tmp/ on desktop

9. Transfer files remotely with sftp
sftp session accepts various commands, ls, cd, mkdir, pwd, rmdir
	a. exit: exits the sftp session
	b. sftp serverX 
	   mkdir hostbackup
	   cd hostbackup
	   put /etc/hosts: Upload the local file /etc/hosts to newly created directory 
	c. get /etc/yum.conf
	   exit: to download remote file /etc/yum.conf from remote host

10. Synchronizing files between systems securely
	a. rsync: securely copy files from one system to another
	b. If two files or directories are similar between two system
	rsync: copy the differences between two
	scp: copy everything
	c. rsync -n: perform a dry run, simulation of what happens when the command really gets executed
	d. rsync -v: add verbosity to the output 
	e. rsync -a: archive mode, enables following options all in one
		i. -r: synchronizing recursively the whole directory tree
		ii. -l: synchronize symbolic links
		iii. -p: preserve permissions 
		iv. -t: preserve time stamps
		v. -g: preserve group ownership
		vi. -o: preserve the owner of the file
		vii. -D: synchronize device files
	f. rsync -H: Enables handling of hardlinks
